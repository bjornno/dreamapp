My "dreamapp"! Maven archetype that creates a bundled executable winstone java webapplication. Run the application in four ways, as a maven jetty:run, as unit test in your IDE, as executable war or inside a appserver as a war. The application is a batch process application based on Camel and with a REST interface backed by in memory datasource with SSL server and client authentication (certificates) support. It will soon be extended with a repository layer, and some configuration for setting up different datasource etc.

Here is how to create your "dreamapp":

mvn archetype:create -DarchetypeGroupId=com.github.bjornno -DarchetypeArtifactId=dreamapp -DarchetypeVersion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DgroupId=<groupId> -DartifactId=<artifactId> -DremoteRepositories=http://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public
open your new project in your favorite IDE and start ApplicationLauncher with noSSL argument.
Voila, and see your resources at http://localhost:8080/resource/
Try copy the pom.xml file and drop it in target/data/in and see what happens, check out http://localhost:8080/resource/ again.
