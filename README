My "dreamapp"! Maven archetype that creates a bundled executable winstone java webapplication. Run the application in four ways, as a maven jetty:run, as unit test in your IDE, as executable war or inside a appserver as a war. The application is a spring web/REST application backed by in memory datasource with SSL server and client authentication (certificates) support. It will soon be extended with a repository layer, and some configuration for setting up different datasource etc.

Heres how to create your "dreamapp":

git clone git://github.com/bjornno/dreamapp.git
cd dreamapp
mvn clean install
cd to directory where you want to create your app
mvn archetype:create -DarchetypeGroupId=bjornno -DarchetypeArtifactId=dreamapp -DarchetypeVersion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DgroupId=<your group id> -DartifactId=<your artifact id>
cd <your artifact id>
mvn clean install
java -jar target/<your artifact id>.<version>-standalone.jar // or any of the other four ways you prefer..

Voila, and see your rest resource at http://localhost:8080/resource/1
