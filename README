My "dreamapp"! Maven archetype that creates a bundled executable java jetty webapplication. Run the application in four ways, as a maven jetty:run, as unit test in your IDE, as executable war or inside a appserver as a war. The application is a simple REST interface backed by in memory datasource with SSL server and client authentication (certificates) support. It will soon be extended some configuration support for setting up different datasource etc.

Here is how to create your "dreamapp":

mvn archetype:create -DarchetypeGroupId=com.github.bjornno -DarchetypeArtifactId=dreamapp -DarchetypeVersion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DgroupId=<groupId> -DartifactId=<artifactId> -DremoteRepositories=http://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public

Open your new project in your favorite IDE and start src/test/ApplicationLauncher.
